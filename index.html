                Oh  out near Stonehenge, I lived alone
                Oh out near Gamehendge, I chafed a bone
                Wilson, King of Prussia, I lay this hate on you
                Wilson, Duke of Lizards
                I beg it all trune for you
                Talk my duke a mountain, Helping Friendly Book
                Inasfar as fiefdom, I think you bad crook
                Wilson, King of Prussia, I lay this hate on you
                Wilson, Duke of Lizards
                I beg it all trune for you
                I talked to my son Roger, Rutherford the same
                [or "I talked to Mike Christian, Rog and Pete the same"]
                When we had that meeting, over down near Game(henge)
                Wilson, King of Prussia, I lay this hate on you
                Wilson, Duke of Lizards
                I beg it all trune for you
              </p>
              <p>  
                You got me back thinkin' that you're the worst one
                I must inquire, Wilson
                Can you still have fun?
                Wilson
                Can you still have fun?
                Wilson
                Can you still have fun?
                Wilson
              </p>
                <P>
                Meanwhile, in the main square in Prussia, the state of the revolution was taking another turn for the worst. A crowd of townspeople had gathered to witness the hanging of Wilson's accountant, Mr. Palmer. 
                It seemed that Palmer had been a revolutionary himself and had been extorting Wilson's money to fund the revolution. Palmer stood on the scaffold with Wilson and the AC/DC Bag, an electrified robot-hangman with a black bag over his head. Wilson seemed pleased as he began to speak.
